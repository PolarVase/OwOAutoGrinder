# __How To Use:__
1. Download Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Download Python 3.9.5
1. Download the main.py
1. Now since i used multiple modules in the file. You are going to download them. I use linux so i can't turn the thing into a .exe file. And if you are using linux u probably already know how to do these stuff.
    1. ```pip install requests```
    1. ```pip install pypresence```
    1. ```pip install discord.py```
    1. ```pip install discord```
1. Get your discord token. Program will need it to do some of the stuff.
1. After this open "main.py" with a text editor of your own choice. In the 13th line (as of now) there is a variable called dcToken. Now paste your token in to the quotation marks (""). Something like this:

1. Obviously that was a fake token. Anyways, now you are off to go! Double Click the "main.py" and a console window will pop up in your screen. Just wait a few seconds as it will ready up the bot. After the bot is up and going. Go to the channel where you are gonna do the thing at. Now type >setchannel
1. After this the bot will set the channel. Now type >start
